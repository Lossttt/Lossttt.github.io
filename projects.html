        <h4>The main project in my final year of high school was a report about Complex Numbers, I have been working on this project with my friends; David, Gavin and Joshua. It was a very exciting journey to create such a complex and interesting report. Below you will find some very interesting and educational videos about the complex numbers. Special credits to Gavin and David who put an enormous amount of effort and time into creating the models and the actual video!</h4>

      <h2>Main Project of 2022</h2>
      <h4>Now I'm working on a project called "The Challenge", the goal is to make a prototype that is as innovative and useful as possible to solve a certain problem. My group and I are currently designing a prototype that measures the risk of a forest fire in a certain area. Nowadays we see more often in the news that certain regions are ravaged by fierce forest fires, such as France and Spain. For our prototype we use a temperature sensor and an air and soil moisture sensor that we connect to an Arduino. The data that is collected in this process eventually enters a database via our server, which then calculates which areas pose a risk of a forest fire. With this information we hope to help certain organizations (such as local municipalities, forest rangers and/or the fire brigade) with preventively fighting forest fires. 
        <br>
        <h4>We made a number of renders of our prototype with the help of my good friend Gavin, we thought it was important that the product is camouflaged to ensure that it remains out of sight for animals and humans as much as possible. If maintenance is required on our prototype, it is equipped with a lock on the side that allows a technician or other competent person to easily perform his task.</h4>
