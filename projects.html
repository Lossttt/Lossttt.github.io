    <!-- <h4>The main project of 2022 was a report about Complex Numbers, I have been working on this project with my friends; David, Gavin and Joshua. It was a very exciting journey to create such a complex and interesting report.</h4> -->

      <h4>Now I'm working on a project called "The Challenge", the goal is to make a prototype that is as innovative and useful as possible to solve a certain problem. My group and I are currently designing a prototype that measures the risk of a forest fire in a certain area. Nowadays we see more often in the news that certain regions are ravaged by fierce forest fires, such as France and Spain. For our prototype we use a temperature sensor and an air and soil moisture sensor that we connect to an Arduino. The data that is collected in this process eventually enters a database via our server, which then calculates which areas pose a risk of a forest fire. With this information we hope to help certain organizations (such as local municipalities, forest rangers and/or the fire brigade) with preventively fighting forest fires.</h4>
